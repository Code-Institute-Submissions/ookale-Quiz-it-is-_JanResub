## Features

### Existing Features



## Features left to implement

Working quiz to start with. 



## Testing

### Validator Testing

- HTML
Messy code and came back with many bugs due to my performance to try and fix my JavaScript code. W3C validator


-CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. A bit messy also due to the same reason as above. 

- Lighthouse came back with good accessability. 


## Unfixed bugs
Whole web application is a bug at the moment. 

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

### Sites I found with some help on how to explain the process

[Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/) helped me to grasp some of the JavaScript language on how to write code for a quiz. Unfortunately I found it too late in the process of my milestone project.
