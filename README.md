This quiz is for anyone interested in sports and want to try their knowledge. 
Play against familly or friends and see who scores the highest score!

- The game consists of ten questions on random sports. For each question you have four diferent choices to choose from.
- There is a counter that tells you which question you are on at the moment. 
- After the quiz is finished there is a button you can click to show how many correct answers you got.
- There is a Restart button that you can click on to start the game over again.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Start page
The first page I made with a dark green square with a small dark-green border against a black background for easier reading a navigation. I start with a question to get the users attention and then the big light-green button that says 'Let's play'

- Questions page
I have the same black background and dakr-green square but choose thw white font color as I feels it makes the qestions easier to read. Question with four different options in the form of Radio buttons. Below the options you will find the restart and next button, depending on how you would like to proceed. For these buttons i kept the same light-green color and black font color as the button in the first page.

- Last question
When you reach and have choosen and submitted your answer for the last question the restart button is still there as an option and also a new button appears. 'Show Result' The counter above the question is showing 10/10 letting us know for sure that this is the last question.

When you click the 'Show Result' button you score will appear underneath the questions square. Here I also opted for a light-green color against the black background to easier readability.

## Features left to implement

- I would like to add different messages depending on how many correct answers you got. 
- Maybe add a timer with a maximum time you have to complete the quiz. 
- In the future you could add a 'back' button for each question if you would like to change your answer. Having the quiz without the 'back' button puts some more pressure on you though. 
- Add a high score list and also add how much time they used for each session.



## Testing

### Validator Testing

- HTML
No errors were found when using the official W3C validator.


- CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. 

- Lighthouse came back with good accessability. 

### Responsiveness
- Whole page is responsive on smaller screens and mobiles


## Unfixed bugs
- The radio buttons for the four choices are at the moment not vertically aligned. 

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
